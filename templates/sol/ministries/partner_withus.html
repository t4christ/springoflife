Giving to Missions is God's master plan of spreading the gospel and establishing His Kingdom. It is the definite Bible principle. When you enter into a partnership with this ministry and you give into the spreading of the Gospel, you activate a spiritual principle of sowing, reaping, and blessing in your own life. What you make room for, will make room for you. There is grace and anointing in partnership.  When you make room for the anointing; the anointing makes room for you! By blessing those dedicated to advancing the gospel amongst the unreached and the have- nots, you make room for God to bless you and provide for you. The Lord promises us that He sees and rewards every good thing we do, motivated by a pure heart.
Â 

When we Partner in ministryâ€”standing with each other, believing for each other and supporting each
otherâ€”miracles become commonplace. Graces and  anointings combine and open doors that allow us each to do exceeding abundantly above all we could ask or think. Your calling, career, business, ministry, matter how great or small, becomes part of what we doâ€¦and vice versaâ€¦so there's nothing the enemy can do to stop us!</p>
