On several visits home from school where she was an undergraduate of Economics & Statistics Education at the University of Benin, Edo State, in the late 90s, she would meet brother Henry Oise who introduced her to the Holy Spirirt. This was the beginniing of a a beautiful family bond that would grow for decades into the future.
Mrs Shodunke believes strongly in the family unit and reaches out to mothers especially, teaching, sharing, encouraging and enlightening them on ways to build themselves, their homes and businesses or careers without any necessarily having to suffer. (Proverbs 31).

She (like her mum) is a strong believer in giving and sensitizing others to give of their time, financial, material resources and indeed various other forms of resources to the work of the Kingdom, especially global missions.

We are honoured to have her  serve as a trustee of the Springs of life Global evangelistic ministry(SOL).




She has served in various capacities in the corporate world as an employee and business owner and continues to play her role in changing lives for the better with eternity in view. 

 

She is  happily married and blessed with 3 daughters.

                            Apart from his medical training, Dr.Ohihoin is a trained Arbitrator and Mediator with a bias towards resolving disputes in the Health sector. He was enrolled as a member of the Chartered Institute of arbitrators of the United Kingdom, after becoming the first medical doctor to pass the accelerated membership exams. Shortly after, he was enrolled as a CEDR accredited mediator by exams also becoming the first medical doctor to have achieved this feat in the country.

                            His experience in mediation is largely, but not restricted to the health sector, where he has been involved in several high profile mediations.
