                    <h2>Who we are</h2>
                    <h3>Vision</h3>
                    <p>To take the Gospel of Christ to places where the light of God's knowledge is absent, where the Gospel has not been heard and the power of God not known. Romans15:16-21</p>
                    <h3>Mission</h3>
                    <p>We exist to honour God. We do so by planting Christ-centered, Spirit-empowered, socially responsible churches and schools in every nation.</p>
                    <h3>Statement of Faith</h3>
                    <p>We believe ...
                    </p>
                  
                    <ul  class="statement">
                       <li>i. That the Bible is inspired, authoritative and infallible in its teachings, facts and events. 2 Timothy 3:16.</li> 
                       <li>ii. That God is a triune being, He is One in a very different sense from the sense in which He is three. He is one in His Spiritual essence ( Deut.6:4) and plural in the distinctiveness of His personalities ( Genesis 1: 26; 11 :7, Isaiah 6 : 8 ). The New Testament reveals three personalities within the God head; the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Act 17:29, Mathew 28:19, 2Corithians 13:14.</li>
                       <li>iii. That Jesus Christ is deity born of a virgin, Mary ( Isaiah 7 :14; Matthew 1 :23, John 1: 1 -3,14).</li>
                       <li>iv. That the dead, burial, and ressurection of Jesus Christ is the only means of Grace for the saving of the soul of man. 1 Corinthians 15 : 1 - 4.</li>
                       <li>v. In believers baptism by immersion (for places without persecution and where there is the presence of a body of water). Matthew 28 : 18 - 20.</li>
                       <li>vi. In believers' transformation through the application of God's Word and the sanctifying ministry of the Holy Spirit and their collaborative obedience. Acts 26 :18; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Peter 1:2; 1 Thessalonians 4 : 3 - 4.</li>
                       <li>vii. In the present supernatural ministry of the Holy Spirit who bestows spiritual gifts and fruits on believers. 1 Corinthians 12, Galatians 5 : 22 - 23. </li>
                       <li>viii. In the physical ressurection of saved believers at the second coming of Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15 : 52, 1 Thessalonians 4 : 16. </li>
                       <li>ix. In the final judgement of the unsaved. Revelations 20 : 11 - 15.</li>
                       <li>x. Eternal rewards of the Saints. Daniel 12 : 1 - 3, 2 Corinthians 5 : 10, Luke 19 : 17, Matthew 25: 15 - 21.</li>
                    </ul>

                     <h3><img style="height:50px;width:50px;margin-right:5px;" src="{% static 'images/sol/about-icon/core_icon.png' %}"/>Core Values</h3>
                     In SOL our core values articulate for us the good deposit that is the core of our identity and how we do ministry. Whether we are building a discipleship group, planting a new church, teaching in our educational schools etc, our core values help describe who we are and how we build.

                    <h3><img style="height:50px;width:50px;margin-right:5px;" src="{% static 'images/sol/about-icon/lord_icon.png' %}"/>Lordship</h3>
                    Because Jesus is “King of kings and Lord of lords,” we believe that whole-hearted submission to God’s will and his Word is the starting point of faith and the foundation of all spiritual growth. Colossians 2 : 6.

                    <h3><img style="height:50px;width:50px;margin-right:5px;" src="{% static 'images/sol/about-icon/evan_icon.png' %}"/>Evangelism</h3>
                    Because God’s heart is to reach the lost, we are passionate about preaching the gospel and doing ministry in a way that engages people outside of the Christian faith. We seek to build churches primarily through evangelizing areas where no churches previously exist, and in areas that can act as catalyst for the fulfilment of the Great Commission ( even in such areas, we seek conversion rather than transfer growth, birth rather adoption). John 3 :16; Luke 19:10.

                    <h3><img style="height:50px;width:50px;margin-right:5px;" src="{% static 'images/sol/about-icon/disc_icon.png' %}"/>Discipleship</h3>
                    Because we’re called to make disciples, our primary focus is establishing biblical foundations, equipping believers to minister, and empowering disciples to make disciples. Matthew 28 : 19 - 20.

                    <h3><img style="height:50px;width:50px;margin-right:5px;" src="{% static 'images/sol/about-icon/cross_icon.png' %}"/>Cross-cultural </h3>
                    Cross-cultural means we take into congnisance, the language, ethnos and culture of a people and place. We recognise that to reach the unreached and to touch the untouched we will need to be cross-cultural in our evangelism and discipleship. The vision of God's kingdom is multi-cultural ( Revelation 7:9), SOL seeks to do its part towards the realization. 

                    <h3><img  style="height:50px;width:50px;margin-right:5px;"src="{% static 'images/sol/about-icon/lead_icon.png' %}"/>Leadership</h3>
                    Because we’re called to establish churches and start schools( in areas where such do not exist), we are committed to a culture of empowering leadership. We’re intentionally multi-generational, and we deliberately create opportunities and platforms to develop the next generation of leaders. 2 Timothy 2 : 2.

                    <h3><img style="height:50px;width:50px;margin-right:5px;" src="{% static 'images/sol/about-icon/social_responsible_icon.png' %}"/>Socially Responsible</h3>

                    Socially Responsible 
                    Our love for Jesus and our compassion for people compel us to be socially responsible,  which includes addressing social injustice,  developing people to a point of self-reliance, and providing emergency relief. We always desire spiritual transformation through the gospel.
                    The following scriptures form our grid for social responsibility:
                    Micah 6 : 8. Matthew 25 :35,40. Matthew 5:13,14,15. Ephesians 2 :10


                    <h3><img style="height:50px;width:50px;margin-right:5px;" src="{% static 'images/sol/about-icon/family_icon.png' %}"/>Family</h3>
                    Because the family is the foundation and validation of ministry, we refuse to sacrifice our marriages and our children on the altars of temporal success. And because we believe God has called us to be a spiritual family, we embrace community, reject the idea of disposable relationships, and choose to walk in love, respect, and unity. Psalm 127 : 1 - 3.

                            Margaret Olufemi Nwakanma was born on the 29th of September 1956 to Bishop J.U.Itegboje who devoted his life to missionary works  in Auchi and around Estako and  Akoko-Edo local government areas of Edo State. 
In those years when Auchi was still predominantly Moslem, Bishop Itegboje fearlessly preached the gospel,  confronting principalities and powers as he moved around the town in prayers late in the night, returning home in the early hours of the morning. The same deep and fearless missionary grace that was in Bishop J. U. Itegboje of blessed memory now rests firmly on her daughter.  God in His rich mercies have ensured a change of baton from father to daughter. 

Margaret Olufemi Nwakanma attended Federal  Government  college Ibillo and went further to obtain her diploma certificate in teaching at Imaguero teacher's college Benin City. Shortly after her studies,  she got married to Mr Brandon Nwakanma who spent his career as a diplomat serving in various countries including the United States of America, Somalia,  Greece,  Equatorial Guinea etc.

Margaret Olufemi Nwakanma received the call to full time ministry in an encounter with the Lord.  In this vision the Lord asked her to give up her lucrative business and to do His business. She subsequently obeyed the Lord, traveling the North and South of Nigeria in missionary forays.  

Margaret Olufemi Nwakanma was before her encounter with the Lord a business woman and was an importer of goods  to Nigeria. She was the founder of Rose Maggie Nigeria Limited. After heeding the call of God, she joined Springs of Life Evangelistic Ministry(SOL) in the year 2001. She has served meritoriously
and selflessly in SOL as an evangelist, teacher and a strong advocate for missions involvement and support. 

It is an honour and a privilege to have Mrs Margaret Olufemi Nwakanma serve as Chairman of the board of trustees of the Springs of Life Global Evangelistic Ministry (SOL).

                      Henry Oise is the lead missioner of the Springs of life global evangelistic Ministry(SOL). The  ministry honours God by planting churches in places where no church previously existed as well as  starting free-tuition schools in places where no school exists. 

                        Henry Oise has two bachelors degrees in Geography(Bsc.ed) from Delta State University, Abraka and  in Missiology from the West Africa Christian University (WACU) Sango-Ota. He is an Alumni of the Christian leadership training Institute( CLTS) Ibadan. Henry Oise has authored four books and he is in his twentieth year in his missionary endeavours.

                        The ministry he leads has four mission fields :
                        OWUDEKUDU mission field ( which compromises of 9 villages). 
                        AKOGUN mission field( which compromises of six villages).
                        ISHOKO mission field ( which compromises of 10 villages) and
                        ONIDUNDUN  mission field( which compromises of eleven villages). 

                        The mission runs two free-tuition schools in Owudekudu  and Ishoko villages of Ogun state. Books, uniforms and writing materials are provided freely for these kids. The primary school at  Owudekudu  has 138 children while the primary school at Ishoko ( which is barely six months old) has 66 children. Because of the limited resources SOL has a ceiling on the number of kids they can admit by session. The schools go by the name : New Life Academy, and it recently was approved by the Ogun state ministry of education. 

                        The Churches SOL plants in the villages go by the name : New Life Bible Church. 

                        The Focus of SOL's evangelism and discipleship efforts so far is amongst  the Yorubas  and the Adja ethnic groups. The Adja people are from Benin republic and majority of them are farmers who in recent times have settled in large numbers in Ogun state .

                            Oghenekaro Onohwakpo is a believer of long standing. At an early age he was very devout and was one of the youngest Sunday School Teachers  in the  Anglican Church. One faithful day, while studying for his exams while still a  Secondary School student, he fell asleep. In his sleep he had a vision where he received a clear directive to dedicate his life to God and to pledge his personal allegiance to Christ. That same evening , he answered an altar call to give his life to Jesus Christ. His life had never been the same from that day. 

                            Mr  Onohwakpo is a graduate of  electrical and electronics engineering from the prestigious  University of Benin( Uniben ), Ugbowo. While a student,  he joined the Christian Union and rose to become the leader of the Discipleship activity group. In 1998  he attended the missions conference GOFEST at the redemption camp and his life and vision was completely revolutionised.  On return from GOFEST  he became a founding member of  Christian Student in Mission Uniben, and later its coordinator. In 2003 he became the State President  of the Nigeria's Christians Corpers fellowship  (NCCF) Ogun state,  where he was fully committed to Rural rugged evangelism, reaching several villages with the gospel  and  encouraging rural pastors and missionaries in the process. 

                            Mr Onohwakpo works in the Oil industry,  and despite his busy schedule finds the  time to serve as a pastoral assistant at the Anglican Church Transfiguration, as well as frequenting SOL field whenever he finds the time.
