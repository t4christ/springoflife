                      Henry Oise is the lead missioner of the Springs of life global evangelistic Ministry(SOL). The  ministry honours God by planting churches in places where no church previously existed as well as  starting free-tuition schools in places where no school exists. 

                        Henry Oise has two bachelors degrees in Geography(Bsc.ed) from Delta State University, Abraka and  in Missiology from the West Africa Christian University (WACU) Sango-Ota. He is an Alumni of the Christian leadership training Institute( CLTS) Ibadan. Henry Oise has authored four books and he is in his twentieth year in his missionary endeavours.

                        The ministry he leads has four mission fields :
                        OWUDEKUDU mission field ( which compromises of 9 villages). 
                        AKOGUN mission field( which compromises of six villages).
                        ISHOKO mission field ( which compromises of 10 villages) and
                        ONIDUNDUN  mission field( which compromises of eleven villages). 

                        The mission runs two free-tuition schools in Owudekudu  and Ishoko villages of Ogun state. Books, uniforms and writing materials are provided freely for these kids. The primary school at  Owudekudu  has 138 children while the primary school at Ishoko ( which is barely six months old) has 66 children. Because of the limited resources SOL has a ceiling on the number of kids they can admit by session. The schools go by the name : New Life Academy, and it recently was approved by the Ogun state ministry of education. 

                        The Churches SOL plants in the villages go by the name : New Life Bible Church. 

                        The Focus of SOL's evangelism and discipleship efforts so far is amongst  the Yorubas  and the Adja ethnic groups. The Adja people are from Benin republic and majority of them are farmers who in recent times have settled in large numbers in Ogun state .

She (like her mum) is a strong believer in giving and sensitizing others to give of their time, financial, material resources and indeed various other forms of resources to the work of the Kingdom, especially global missions.

                            Margaret Olufemi Nwakanma was born on the 29th of September 1956 to Bishop J.U.Itegboje who devoted his life to missionary works  in Auchi and around Estako and  Akoko-Edo local government areas of Edo State. 
In those years when Auchi was still predominantly Moslem, Bishop Itegboje fearlessly preached the gospel,  confronting principalities and powers as he moved around the town in prayers late in the night, returning home in the early hours of the morning. The same deep and fearless missionary grace that was in Bishop J. U. Itegboje of blessed memory now rests firmly on her daughter.  God in His rich mercies have ensured a change of baton from father to daughter. 

Margaret Olufemi Nwakanma attended Federal  Government  college Ibillo and went further to obtain her diploma certificate in teaching at Imaguero teacher's college Benin City. Shortly after her studies,  she got married to Mr Brandon Nwakanma who spent his career as a diplomat serving in various countries including the United States of America, Somalia,  Greece,  Equatorial Guinea etc.

Margaret Olufemi Nwakanma received the call to full time ministry in an encounter with the Lord.  In this vision the Lord asked her to give up her lucrative business and to do His business. She subsequently obeyed the Lord, traveling the North and South of Nigeria in missionary forays.  

Margaret Olufemi Nwakanma was before her encounter with the Lord a business woman and was an importer of goods  to Nigeria. She was the founder of Rose Maggie Nigeria Limited. After heeding the call of God, she joined Springs of Life Evangelistic Ministry(SOL) in the year 2001. She has served meritoriously
and selflessly in SOL as an evangelist, teacher and a strong advocate for missions involvement and support. 

It is an honour and a privilege to have Mrs Margaret Olufemi Nwakanma serve as Chairman of the board of trustees of the Springs of Life Global Evangelistic Ministry (SOL).
